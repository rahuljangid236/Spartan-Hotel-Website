                                    Built in 1747 A.D. by Malhar Rao Holkar, founder of Holkar Dynasty, the Rajwada
                                    Palace was known to be the commercial hub where all the trading activities of
                                    the city took place. It is known to have been subjected to three incidents of
                                    fire and was restored to its lost glory in 2006. It was revamped under the
                                    supervision of H.H. Ushadevi Holkar, the Maharani of Indore. A fusion of the
                                    Maratha, Mughal and French architectural styles, the palace is known for its
                                    beautiful design comprising of fountains, an artificial waterfall and a few
                                    wonderful pieces of sculptures dating back to the 11th-century. What is
                                    particularly remarkable about this Indore attraction is the enchanting beauty of
                                    Rani Ahilya throne, Ganesha Hall and Darbar Hall. As the twilight sets in, the
                                    palace also allures a swarm of young visitors for a Light and Sound Show.

                The vacation season is here and this is particularly true for non-resident Indians (NRIs), who visit
                their homes and families. Vacations are an exorbitant affair and need thorough planning. Sometimes this
                can be a bitter experience for guests when al they wanted was to relax and spend some quality time with
                their loved ones.

                NRIs with relatives in India could save on accommodation costs but it certainly doesn't offer the same
                amount of privacy that he/she could enjoy when living by themselves. Therefore, it isn't uncommon to see
                NRIs choosing a hotel for their accommodation during their stay. Another reason for choosing a hotel is
                that it allows them to truly experience and explore the essence of India. There are very few hotels that
                offer both, and Pride Plaza Hotel Aerocity- Delhi is one such hotel!

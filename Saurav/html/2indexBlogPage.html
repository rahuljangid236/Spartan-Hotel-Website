                    Indian weddings are traditionally multi-day affairs, and involve many intricate ceremonies, such as
                    the painting of the hands and feet of the bride called a mehndi. Garlands are presented to guests of
                    honor instead of corsages, and lots of flower or rose petals are thrown for good luck.

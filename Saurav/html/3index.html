                                Inhabited by the heirs of the Holkar dynasty, this splendid palace is the epitome of
                                grandeur and grace. Spread over a sprawling expanse of 28 acres, it is a superb example
                                of the architectural brilliance of the time. Overlooking the Khan River, this palace was
                                constructed with much endurance and diligence for over 35 long years! Today, this Indore
                                attraction stands as a museum housing some of the most valuable artefacts of the Maratha
                                & Mughal Empire. It boasts of outstanding architectural features like Italian marble
                                columns, rich Persian carpets, grand chandeliers, Belgium stained glass windows and
                                Italian style wall paintings. The palace-turned-museum opens its doors between 10:00 AM
                                â€“ 5:00 PM on all days of the week barring Monday.

                                        Built in 1747 A.D. by Malhar Rao Holkar, founder of Holkar Dynasty, the Rajwada
                                        Palace was known to be the commercial hub where all the trading activities of
                                        the city took place. It is known to have been subjected to three incidents of
                                        fire and was restored to its lost glory in 2006. It was revamped under the
                                        supervision of H.H. Ushadevi Holkar, the Maharani of Indore. A fusion of the
                                        Maratha, Mughal and French architectural styles, the palace is known for its
                                        beautiful design comprising of fountains, an artificial waterfall and a few
                                        wonderful pieces of sculptures dating back to the 11th-century. What is
                                        particularly remarkable about this Indore attraction is the enchanting beauty of
                                        Rani Ahilya throne, Ganesha Hall and Darbar Hall. As the twilight sets in, the
                                        palace also allures a swarm of young visitors for a Light and Sound Show.
